\begin{abstract}
  We propose an improvement of \citepos{barker2015} {\NLCL} for which
  derivability is decidable, which has a normal-form for proof search,
  can analyse scope islands, and distinguish between strong and weak
  quantifiers.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
In this paper, we examine \citepos{barker2015} {\NLCL}. We discuss an
extension to their logic, which allows us to analyse scope islands.
We then propose two extensions which allow us to analyse strong and
weak quantifiers:
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
\item a syntactic mechanism, using the encodings of logical
  combinators in the style of \citet{finger2001} and
  \citet{barker2015}; and
\item a \emph{combined} semantic and syntactic mechanism, using the
  continuation-passing style (CPS) semantics described by
  \citet{moortgat2012}.
\end{enumerate*}
To be able to use their CPS semantics, we develop a focused variant of
{\NLCL}. An added benefit this is that we solve the problem of spurious
ambiguity for this calculus. In closing, we briefly compare our solution
to the purely semantic solution developed by \citet{kiselyov2014}.

\subsubsection*{Linguistic data}\label{sec:linguistic-data}
We will start out by discussing the linguistic data which motivates
our extensions to {\NLCL}.
Examples (\ref{ex:scope-ambiguity}), (\ref{ex:scope-ambiguity}) and
(\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}) are based on examples in
\citet[][p.\ 608, 622]{szabolcsi2000}.
Example (\ref{ex:np-quantifier}) is based on an example in
\citet[][p.\ 208]{barker2015}.
\eenumsentence{\label{ex:scope-ambiguity}
\item[]\hspace*{-0.5\leftmargin}``Someone read every book.''
\item$\exists{x}.\PERSON(x)\wedge\forall{y}.\BOOK(y)\supset\READ(x,y)$
\item$\forall{y}.\BOOK(y)\supset\exists{x}.\PERSON(x)\wedge\READ(x,y)$}%
\eenumsentence{\label{ex:scope-island}
\item[]\hspace*{-0.5\leftmargin}``Someone said Kurt wrote every book.''
\item$\exists{x}.\PERSON(x)\wedge\SAY(x,\forall{y}.\BOOK(y)\supset\WROTE(\KURT,y))$}%
\eenumsentence{\label{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}
\item[]\hspace*{-0.5\leftmargin}``Everyone said [Kurt dedicated a book to Mary].''
\item$\forall{x}.\PERSON(x)\supset\SAY(x,\exists{y}.\BOOK(y)\wedge\DEDICATE(\KURT,\MARY,y))$
\item$\forall{x}.\PERSON(x)\supset\exists{y}.\BOOK(y)\wedge\SAY(x,\DEDICATE(\KURT,\MARY,y))$
\item$\exists{y}.\BOOK(y)\wedge\forall{x}.\PERSON(x)\supset\SAY(x,\DEDICATE(\KURT,\MARY,y))$}%
\eenumsentence{\label{ex:np-quantifier}
\item[]\hspace*{-0.5\leftmargin}``John read a book [the author of which] feared the ocean.''
\item$\exists{x}.\BOOK(x)\wedge\FEAR(\iota(\lambda{y}.\OF(y,\AUTHOR,x)),\iota(\OCEAN))\wedge\READ(\JOHN,x)$}
Example (\ref{ex:scope-ambiguity}) is the canonical example of scope
ambiguity: there is ambiguity caused by the order in which the
quantifiers ``someone'' and ``every book'' take scope.
%
Example (\ref{ex:scope-island}) demonstrates a scope island:
there is no reading in which ``every book'' scopes out of the embedded
clause, as this reading would imply that the speaker made a separate
speech act for every book: ``Kurt wrote Slaughterhouse-Five'', ``Kurt
wrote Cat's Cradle'', ``Kurt wrote\ldots''
%
Example (\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}) shows that indefinites
\emph{can} scope out of scope islands.
%
Lastly, example (\ref{ex:np-quantifier}) illustrates the need for
quantifiers which can take scope at non-sentence nodes: ``which'' must
take scope over ``[$_{\text{NP}}$ the author of \_]'', obtain and
insert a reference to the book in question, and `move' this entire
constituent into the subject position of ``\_ the ocean''.

\subsubsection*{{\NLLAM}, {\NLCL}}
\citet{barker2015} develop an extension to the non-associative Lambek
calculus \citep[NL;][]{lambek1961} which they call {\NLCL}. The history
behind this axiomatisation is somewhat intricate, but helpful to
understanding, so we will briefly go over it. The initial idea comes
from the practice of encoding quantifier movement as a tree
transformation which introduces a binder~\citep{heim1998}:
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \tikzset{level distance=4ex}
      \tikzset{sibling distance=0pt}
      \Tree [ john [ likes everyone ] ]
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{minipage}%
  \begin{minipage}{0.05\linewidth}\centering
    $\longleftrightarrow$
  \end{minipage}%
  \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}\centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \tikzset{level distance=4ex}
      \tikzset{sibling distance=0pt}
      \Tree [ everyone [ $\lambda x.$ [ john [ likes $x$ ] ] ] ]
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
To implement this idea in type-logical grammar,
\citeauthor{barker2015} add a structural $\lambda$-construct to NL,
and added the following structural postulate:\footnote{%
  It is important to note that this construct is \emph{purely
  structural}, and that it is not accompanied by some implicit form of
  computation (e.g.\ $\beta,\eta$-conversions).
}
\begin{align}
  \tag{$\lambda$}
  \Sigma[\Gamma] \longleftrightarrow \Gamma\hprod\lambda{x}.\Sigma[x]
  \label{eqn:lambda}
\end{align}
The $\hprod$-connective is part of a new residuated family $\{\himpr,
\hprod, \himpl\}$, which starts out as a copy of $\{\impr, \prod,
\impl\}$. However, the addition of the~\eqref{eqn:lambda} postulate
allows you to raise any constituent to the top-left position,
where---if it has the right type---it can be ``resolved'' against the
top-level type as follows:
\vspace*{-1\baselineskip}
\begin{scprooftree}
  \AXC{$\Sigma[{A}]\fCenter{B}$}
  \RightLabel{\eqref{eqn:lambda}}
  \UIC{${A}\hprod\lambda{x}.\Sigma[x]\fCenter{B}$}
  \RightLabel{R$\himpr$}
  \UIC{$\lambda{x}.\Sigma[x]\fCenter{A\himpr B}$}
  \AXC{${C}\fCenter{D}$} \RightLabel{L$\himpl$}
  \BIC{${C\himpl(A\himpr B)}\hprod\lambda{x}.\Sigma[x]\fCenter{D}$}
  \RightLabel{\eqref{eqn:lambda}}
  \UIC{$\Sigma[{C\himpl(A\himpr B)}]\fCenter{D}$}
\end{scprooftree}
\citeauthor{barker2015} call resulting system {\NLLAM}.
While {\NLLAM} fulfils the promise of a syntactic analysis of
quantifier raising, it has some problems. Most notably, it is hard to
formalise and reason about, largely due to the presence of a binding
construct in the syntax of structures. While not impossible to
formalise, the~\eqref{eqn:lambda} postulate greatly complicates the
proofs.

To address this issue, and to ease their own investigation of the
formal properties of {\NLLAM}, \citet[][ch.\ 17]{barker2015} introduce
{\NLCL}. This system uses the fact that $\lambda$-terms can be
represented as combinators in combinatory logic, which removes the
need for a binding construct.
\citeauthor{barker2015} use a variant of Sch\"onfinkel's mapping to
encode the \emph{linear} $\lambda$-construct as applications of the
combinators $\I$, $\B$ and $\C$:\footnote{%
  One can easily verify that the $\lambda$-construct introduced
  by~\eqref{eqn:lambda} is indeed linear.
}
\[
  \I x     = x,
  \qquad
  \B x y z = x (y z),
  \qquad
  \C x y z = x  z y
\]
The resulting system is presented in \autoref{fig:nlcl}.\footnote{%
  In \autoref{fig:nlcl}, and for the remainder of this paper, the
  letter $\Gamma$ is reserved for structures, whereas the $\Sigma$
  is used for contexts.
} When reading this figure, be wary of the difference between the
combinators $\B,\C$ and the formulas $B,C$. Furthermore, when
comparing the above equations to the $\I\B\C$-rules below, note that
$\prod$ encodes a function application, but $\hprod$ encodes a
\emph{flipped} function application.

\input{fig-nlcl}

\noindent
In {\NLCL}, we can do quantifier raising in much the same way as we did
with the~\eqref{eqn:lambda} postulate---although we now have to raise
the quantifier one step at a time, resulting in much more verbose proofs:

\begin{scprooftree}
  \AXC{$\vdots$}\noLine%
  \UIC{$\textsc{john}\prod\textsc{likes}\prod{np}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{\I}
  \UIC{$\textsc{john}\prod\textsc{likes}\prod{np}\hprod\I\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{\B}
  \UIC{$\textsc{john}\prod{np}\hprod{(\B\prod\textsc{likes})\prod\I}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{\B}
  \UIC{${np}\hprod(\B\prod\textsc{john})\prod{(\B\prod\textsc{likes})\prod\I}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{$\himpr R$}
  \UIC{$(\B\prod\textsc{john})\prod{(\B\prod\textsc{likes})\prod\I}\fCenter{np}\himpr{s}$}
  \AXC{${s}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{$\himpl L$}
  \BIC{$\textsc{everyone}\hprod(\B\prod\textsc{john})\prod{(\B\prod\textsc{likes})\prod\I}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{\B}
  \UIC{$\textsc{john}\prod{\textsc{everyone}}\hprod{(\B\prod\textsc{likes})\prod\I}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{\B}
  \UIC{$\textsc{john}\prod\textsc{likes}\prod{\textsc{everyone}\hprod\I}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{\I}
  \UIC{$\textsc{john}\prod\textsc{likes}\prod{\textsc{everyone}}\fCenter{s}$}
\end{scprooftree}

{\NLCL}, see \citet{barker2015}.


\section{Scope islands for {\NLCL}}
Our aim for this section is to present an extension to {\NLCL} which
enables us to give the analysis of example (\ref{ex:scope-island})
which was presented in \autoref{sec:linguistic-data}. In other words,
we would like to be able to analyse scope islands.

To analyse scope islands, we need some way to block quantifier
movement. If you look at the \I\B\C-rules in \autoref{fig:nlcl}, you
will notice that it allows constituents attached to (the left of) a
hollow product to move past solid products.
This leads us to suggest a fairly simple solution: insert
\emph{anything} that is not solid product.
We use a residuated pair of unary connectives, $\di$ and
$\sq$~\citep{morrill1994,moortgat1996}.
The relevant rules are presented in \autoref{fig:scope-islands}.

\input{fig-scope-islands}

\noindent
Using these connectives, we can assign `said' the type
$({np}\impr{s})\impl\di{s}$. Instead of taking a sentence-argument
from the right, `said' now takes a \emph{closed-off} sentence---a
scope island. Have a look at the derivation for example
(\ref{ex:scope-island}) given below:
\begin{scprooftree}
  \AXC{$\textsc{Kurt}\prod\textsc{wrote}\prod\textsc{every}\prod\textsc{book}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{$\di R$}
  \UIC{$\langle \textsc{Kurt}\prod\textsc{wrote}\prod\textsc{every}\prod\textsc{book}\rangle \fCenter\di{s}$}
  \AXC{$\textsc{someone}\prod{({np}\impr{s})}\fCenter{s}$}
  \RightLabel{$\impl L$}
  \BIC{$\textsc{someone}\prod\textsc{said}\prod\langle
    \textsc{Kurt}\prod\textsc{wrote}\prod\textsc{every}\prod\textsc{book}\rangle\fCenter{s}$}
\end{scprooftree}
As long as the scope island (written $\di[\cdot]$) is in place,
`$\textsc{every}\prod\textsc{book}$' cannot be raised past it. But in
order to remove the scope island, it has to be eliminated against the
$\di{s}$ argument of `said', and doing so isolates the embedded clause
in its own branch of the proof.\footnote{%
  The presence of the structural diamond in the endsequent
  may seem problematic, but recall that from the perspective of
  backward-chaining search we assign semantics to a \emph{known}
  sentence structure. If we switch to forward-chaining search, i.e.\ %
  to parsing, the need for a scope island will be inferred from the
  type of `said'.
}

\subsubsection*{A combinator for strong quantifiers}
One possible solution for analysing weak and strong quantifiers is to
split the family $\himpr,\hprod,\himpl$ into two separate families,
$\himpr^w,\hprod^w,\himpl^w$ and $\himpr^s,\hprod^s,\himpl^s$, and
give both of these access to the \I\B\C-rules. We can then add a
structural rule which allows \emph{strong} quantifiers to move out of
a scope island:
\vspace*{-1\baselineskip}
\begin{center}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\Sigma[{\di[\Gamma_1\hprod^s\Gamma_2]}]\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{$\I^*$}
    \UIC{$\Sigma[{\Gamma_2\hprod^s(\I^*\prod\di[\Gamma_1])}]\fCenter\Delta$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
\end{center}
\citet[][ch.\ 17.11]{barker2015} propose a similar construction for
allowing quantifiers to scope over `$\hprod$' in order to analyse
sluicing.

We could continue, and split the modality $\di,\sq$ into a strong and
weak pair as well, and create island from which even strong
quantifiers cannot escape. However, \citet{szabolcsi2000} writes that
``indefinites acquire their existential scope in a manner that does
not involve movement and is essentially syntactically unconstrained.''
In light of this, it seems unlikely that we will have to extend our
syntactic solution to include strong scope islands---and our syntactic
solution to weak versus strong quantifiers seems cumbersome.


\section{Normal-form for {\NLCL}}
\label{sec:normal-form}
\citet[][sec. 3.1]{moortgat2012} define a normal-form calculus for the
Lambek-Grishin (LG) calculus, based on work on focusing by
\citet{andreoli2001} and \citet{bastenhof2011}.
Since NL is a fragment of LG, we can extract a normal-form calculus
for NL from their work. One advantage of the formalism they
use---display calculus \citep{belnap1982}---is that we can
more-or-less freely add structural rules.
\citepos{barker2015} extension of NL, {\NLCL}, consists solely of a copy
of an existing modality ($\impr,\prod,\impl$ to $\himpr,\hprod,\himpl$)
and a number of structural rules. Therefore, by applying these same
changes, we can extend focused display NL to focused display {\NLCL}.
This extension is presented in \autoref{fig:display-nlcl}.

\input{fig-display-nlcl}

The structural rules used in {\NLCL} are problematic, as the \I-rule
makes proof search undecidable---after all, we can always introduce
another \I.
\citet[][ch.\ 17.6]{barker2015} address this, albeit in a convoluted
way. They show that {\NLLAM} can be embedded in {\NLCL}, using a variant
of Sch\"onfinkel's mapping from $\lambda$-terms to combinatory logic.
Later, they show that a pair of derived rules, $\himpl{L_{\lambda}}$
and $\himpr{R_{\lambda}}$, can serve as a normal-form for the
structural rules of {\NLCL}. However, these derived rules employ the
structural $\lambda$ which, in the context of {\NLCL}, is presumably
immediately translated using Sch\"onfinkel's mapping.
Instead of employing this two-step process, we exploit the
similarities between single-hole contexts and linear $\lambda$-terms
to derive a variant of the $\lambda$-rule which directly uses
Sch\"onfinkel's mapping (written $\overline{\cdot}$) \citep[cf.][ch.\ %
17.5]{barker2015}:
\[
  \scalebox{\defscalefactor}{\(
  \begin{aligned}
    &\trace{\Box}             \;&&= \I\\
    &\trace{\Sigma\prod\Gamma}\;&&= ((\C\prod\trace{\Sigma})\prod\Gamma)\\
    &\trace{\Gamma\prod\Sigma}\;&&= ((\B\prod\Gamma)\prod\trace{\Sigma})
  \end{aligned}
  \)}
  \qquad
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\st{A}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{$\uparrow\downarrow$}
    \UIC{$\Sigma[\st{A}]\fCenter\Delta$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
\]
The $\uparrow\downarrow$-rule is written as $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$,
depending on the direction in which it is applied, and is derived by
induction on the structure of the context $\Sigma$:
\[
  \scalebox{\defscalefactor}{$\Box$:}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\st{A}\hprod\:\I\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{\I}
    \UIC{$\st{A}\fCenter\Delta$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
  \quad
  \scalebox{\defscalefactor}{$\Sigma\prod\Gamma$:}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\st{A}\hprod\:((\C\prod\trace{\Sigma})\prod\Gamma)\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{\C}
    \UIC{$(\st{A}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma})\prod\Gamma\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{Res$\impl\prod$}
    \UIC{$\st{A}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\Delta\impl\Gamma$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{$\uparrow\downarrow$}
    \UIC{$\Sigma[\st{A}]\fCenter\Delta\impl\Gamma$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{Res$\impl\prod$}
    \UIC{$\Sigma[\st{A}]\prod\Gamma\fCenter\Delta$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
  \quad
  \scalebox{\defscalefactor}{$\Gamma\prod\Sigma$:}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\st{A}\hprod\:((\B\prod\Gamma)\prod\trace{\Sigma})\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{\B}
    \UIC{$\Gamma\prod(\st{A}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma})\fCenter\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{Res$\impr\prod$}
    \UIC{$\st{A}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\Gamma\impr\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{$\uparrow\downarrow$}
    \UIC{$\Sigma[\st{A}]\fCenter\Gamma\impr\Delta$}
    \doubleLine\RightLabel{Res$\impr\prod$}
    \UIC{$\Gamma\prod\Sigma[\st{A}]\fCenter\Delta$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
\]
Using this derived rule, we can derive variants of the
$\himpl{L_{\lambda}}$- and $\himpr{R_{\lambda}}$-rules. We name these
$qL$  and $qR$, to signify that they no longer employ a structural
$\lambda$, and because they can be composed to implement
\citepos{moortgat1996} $q$-connective:
\[
  \scalebox{\defscalefactor}{$qL$:}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\fc{\q{A}{B}{}}$}
    \AXC{$\fc{C}\fCenter\Delta$}
    \RightLabel{$\himpl L$}
    \BIC{$\fc{\q{A}{B}{C}}\fCenter\Delta\himpl\trace{\Sigma}$}
    \RightLabel{Foc$^L$}
    \UIC{$\st{\q{A}{B}{C}}\fCenter\Delta\himpl\trace{\Sigma}$}
    \RightLabel{Res$\himpl\hprod$}
    \UIC{$\st{\q{A}{B}{C}}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\Delta$}
    \RightLabel{$\uparrow$}
    \UIC{$\Sigma[\st{\q{A}{B}{C}}]\fCenter\Delta$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
  \quad
  \scalebox{\defscalefactor}{$qR$:}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$\Sigma[\st{A}]\fCenter\st{B}$}
    \RightLabel{$\downarrow$}
    \UIC{$\st{A}\hprod\:\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\st{B}$}
    \RightLabel{Res$\hprod\himpr$}
    \UIC{$\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\st{A}\himpr\st{B}$}
    \RightLabel{$\himpr R$}
    \UIC{$\trace{\Sigma}\fCenter\st{\q{A}{B}{}}$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
\]
Proof search with the logical and residuation rules for
$\impr,\prod,\impl$, $\himpr,\hprod,\himpl$ and $\di,\sq$, and the
derived rules $qL$ and $qR$ is decidable and complete.\footnote{
  If we want decidable proof search for our axiomatic system, we
  can restrict access to problematic $\I$-rule to single uses by
  quantifiers using a license.
}

\section{Continuations and wide-scope indefinites}
\subsubsection*{Continuation semantics for {\NLCL}}
\label{sec:continuation-semantics}
A normal-form calculus for proof search is a great improvement for
proof search, but the gain we were really after is \citepos[][sec.\ %
3.1]{moortgat2012} CPS semantics.
We can trivially restrict their translation to NL, and then extend
it to cover {\NLCL}.
In \autoref{fig:cps-semantics}, we present the translation on types
and sequents.
\input{fig-cps-semantics}
We extend the translation on types to a translation on structures as
follows: we translate all structural constants (\I,\B,\C) as units,
forget all unary structural connectives ($\di,\sq$), and translate
binary structural connectives as products. Atomic structures $\st{A}$
are translated as $\tr{A}^-$ or $\tr{A}^+$, depending on the polarity
of the structure $\st{A}$.

In this particular CPS translation, all function applications and
abstractions are contained within the focusing and unfocusing rules,
which are translated as follows:
\begin{center}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$x:\tr{\Delta}\fCenter M:\tr{A}^-$}
    \RightLabel{Foc$^L$}
    \UIC{$k:\tr{A}^+\fCenter (\lambda{x}.k\;M):\tr{\Delta}^R$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$x:\tr{A}^+\fCenter M:\tr{\Delta}^R$}
    \RightLabel{Unf$^L$}
    \UIC{$y:\tr{\Delta}\fCenter (\lambda{x}.M\;y):\tr{A}^-$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
  \\[1\baselineskip]
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$x:\tr{\Gamma}\fCenter M:\tr{A}^+$}
    \RightLabel{Foc$^R$}
    \UIC{$x:\tr{\Gamma}\fCenter (\lambda{k}.k\;M):\tr{A}^{-R}$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
  \begin{scprooftree*}
    \AXC{$x:\tr{\Gamma}\fCenter M:\tr{A}^{-R}$}
    \RightLabel{Unf$^R$}
    \UIC{$x:\tr{\Gamma}\fCenter (\lambda{y}.M\;y):\tr{A}^+$}
  \end{scprooftree*}
\end{center}
The other rules are translated either as axioms ($Ax^L,Ax^R$),
identities ($\impr R,\impl R,\himpr R,\himpl R$ and all rules for
$\di,\sq$) or permutations (the rest). For instance,
\begin{scprooftree}
  \AXC{$x:\tr{\Gamma}\fCenter M:\tr{A}^+$}
  \AXC{$y:\tr{\Delta}\fCenter N:\tr{B}^-$}
  \RightLabel{$\impr L$}
  \BIC{$z:\tr{\Gamma}\times\tr{\Delta}\fCenter(M[\pi_1z/x],N[\pi_2z/y]):\tr{A}^+\times\tr{B}^-$}
\end{scprooftree}
Using these semantics, we can assign the indefinite article the type
$np \impl n$.\footnote{%
  Quantifiers such as ``someone'' should be assigned the type $np\impl
  n\otimes n$, which means we must also extend {\NLCL} with logical
  products.
}
This will result in \emph{two} interpretations for
(\ref{ex:scope-island}), and \emph{three} interpretations for
(\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}), as required. Let us consider the
important steps in the derivation of (\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item the quantifier movement and scope taking of ``everyone'';
\item the collapsing of the scope island, isolating the clause
  ``[$_S$ Kurt .. Mary]'' in its own branch of the derivation;
\item the collapsing of ``a book'', with the indefinite taking scope
  at the top-level.
\end{enumerate}
If these steps are taken [1,2,3], we obtain interpretation
(\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}a); if they are taken [1,3,2], we
obtain (\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}b); and if they are taken
[3,1,2], we obtain (\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite}c).\footnote{%
  The normal-form requires that 1 occurs before 2, so this list is
  exhaustive.
}

\section{Discussion}
We presented an improvement over \citepos{barker2015} {\NLCL} for which
derivability is decidable, and which has a normal-form for proof
search. In addition, it can analyse scope islands, and distinguish
between strong and weak quantifiers, shown by the ability to analyse
examples (\ref{ex:scope-ambiguity}-\ref{ex:np-quantifier}).
Of these examples, (\ref{ex:scope-ambiguity}-\ref{ex:wide-scope-indefinite})
are representative examples of scope islands and strong and weak
quantifiers, for which \citet{kiselyov2014} provides a purely semantic
analysis. The remaining example, (\ref{ex:np-quantifier}), is our
improvement over their work, and motivated us to start from
\citepos{barker2015} syntactic approach.
